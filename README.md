# RigTool
Python script toolkit for rigging in Autodesk Maya

Rigging is the process by which controls for animators are added to a blank skeleton.
This toolset allows the creation of forward and inverse kinematic control sets, ie, each joint can be rotated with the child joints following,
or a specified child (eg hand) joint can be moved freely, and the elbow will move into position accordingly. 
There is also foot roll setup, so the animator can use a simple slider to maniplulate a foot pivoting from the ball of the foot or from the heel.
